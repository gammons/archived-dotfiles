# My dotfiles

My dotfiles are a collection of configs that I've carefully honed over the years.

### Desktop environment

My desktop environment is currently:

- i3 window manager
- Polybar
- Rofi launcher
- Picom compositor
- Redshift
- imwheel

### Terminal setup

- Kitty terminal
- Starship prompt
- Neovim editor

## Experimental items

- Looking into https://github.com/tkkcc/libinput_patch as a way of removing `imwheel` from my setup.
